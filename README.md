# Architecture

The app use the basic clean arch, in order to be modular and has separation of layers.

# External Tools
Sourcery facilitate mock generation and avoid tedious work

# TODO
 - use a register/resolve dependency solution
 - create a protocol module, and register implementations elsewhere
 - finish the UI

# Notes to reviewwer
Unfortunately, I didn't have much time left for the ui,
I could add useCases between presentation and repo, but imo I find the bridge useless
